iProject 1 Notes/Reflection
==========================

* Definitely cut it close on time, will adjust accordingly for next project and give myself more room.
* After going through the code at the end, I can see where I can make improvements and will implement those in the next version.
* Yes I know it is still ugly. Yes I know that does not effect the grade, but I can almost certainly guarantee a prettier interface next time.
* Tried playing around with the line wrapping and I couldn't really get it working, but I know what to do so that'll be the first implementation of the next project
* Need to make more use of github Issues - I'm not too familiar with them, but will look into them
