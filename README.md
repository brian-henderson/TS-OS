iProject 2 Notes/Reflection
==========================

* Updated UI (not ugly anymore! )
* I need to give myself more time on the next project
* Looked at iP3 and saw that I'm going to need to refactor some code, but I have a much better understanding of the OS after this project so I'm looking forward to it
