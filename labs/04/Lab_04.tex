   \subsection*{What is the relationship between a guest operating system and a host operating system in a system like VMware? What factors need to be considered in choosing the host operating system?}
   
   A guest OS provides it's resources and services by mapping them to the host OS, by matching how the host OS provides its functionality. A big factor that should be considered is whether the host OS has a proper system-call interface that can support the features and functionality provided by the guest OS.
